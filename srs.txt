System Requirements Specification (SRS) — Study_Mate
1. System Overview

Study_Mate is an adaptive study-planning platform that captures a learner’s academic workload, difficulty perceptions, unit types, and available study hours, then generates a personalized timetable. The system emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and low operational overhead while enabling intelligent workload orchestration.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 User Management
2.1.1 Account Registration

Users can create an account using email or phone.

System stores name, institution (optional), and academic level.

Password hashing for secure storage.

2.1.2 Login & Authentication

Users authenticate with email + password.

Session management with JWT or secure cookies.

2.1.3 Profile Creation

User inputs:

Number of units

Unit names (optional)

Difficulty rating for each (easy / moderate / hard)

Unit type (exam / practical / project-based)

Expected assessment dates (optional)

Study preference (long blocks / short sprints / mixed)

Weekly and daily availability

2.2 Study Input Module
2.2.1 Unit Configuration

System captures and stores unit meta-data.

Each unit is assigned weights based on:

Difficulty

Assessment type

Time sensitivity (e.g., exam nearing)

2.2.2 Availability Capture

User provides:

Daily available hours (per day)

Weekly free days

Preferences for morning/afternoon/evening sessions

2.3 Allocation Engine

The core logic unit.

2.3.1 Time Distribution

System distributes study hours across units proportionally to their weighted difficulty.

Ensures practical/project units get long-form blocks.

Ensures exam units get boosted allocation near exam period.

2.3.2 Conflict Resolution

If the user's available time is insufficient for the computed plan:

System proposes optimized load-reduction options.

System auto-shifts low-priority units to different slots.

2.3.3 Timetable Optimization

Balances intensity across days (avoiding “burnout days”).

Ensures no two hard units stack back-to-back unless requested.

Applies cognitive load balancing heuristics.

2.4 Timetable Generator
2.4.1 Output Formats

Weekly dashboard view

Day-by-day schedule

Printable PDF export (optional)

Mobile-friendly compact layout

2.4.2 Study Block Types

Deep-focus blocks (60–90 min)

Sprint blocks (25–30 min)

Revision blocks

Break allocations (configurable)

2.4.3 Regeneration

User can regenerate the timetable after changing:

Difficulty levels

Time availability

Unit priorities

New assessment dates

2.5 Add-On Modules (Optional but Supported)
2.5.1 Progress Tracking

Users mark sessions as complete/missed.

System recalibrates the schedule based on execution reality.

2.5.2 Stress Index Monitor

Tracks over-scheduling signals (e.g., too many hours/day).

Suggests workload smoothing.

2.5.3 Exam Proximity Boost

Automatically increases allocation as exam date nears.

2.5.4 Intelligent Revision Engine

Generates micro-revision summaries or flashcards (AI-driven).

3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1 Performance

Schedule generation should not exceed 1.5 seconds.

System must support up to 10,000 concurrent users (scalable via container orchestration).

3.2 Usability

Intuitive onboarding with minimal data entry friction.

Clean UI with 3-click rule to generate a full study plan.

3.3 Reliability

99% uptime target for cloud deployment.

Autosave after each user input step.

3.4 Security

AES-256 for data-at-rest.

TLS 1.3 for all communications.

Strict permission boundaries—no admin overrides of personal schedules.

3.5 Scalability

Modular backend to support:

More unit attributes

AI insights

Institutional-level dashboards (future)

3.6 Maintainability

Microservice-ready architecture.

Clear module boundaries (User, Units, Engine, Timetable, Add-ons).

Environment-agnostic setup (Docker-first approach).

4. System Architecture Overview

Frontend: React / Next.js (mobile-first responsive design)

Backend: Node.js (Express) or FastAPI (Python) — both are compatible

Database: PostgreSQL (relational workload fits perfectly)

Model Layer: Weighted rule-based engine + optional ML addon

Deployment: Docker containers, CI/CD pipelines, scalable via Kubernetes or lightweight Docker Swarm

5. External Interfaces
5.1 API Interface

RESTful JSON endpoints for all components.

OAuth2-ready for institutions.

5.2 Integrations (Future-facing)

LMS integration (Moodle, Blackboard)

Calendar integration (Google Calendar / iCal)

Device notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
